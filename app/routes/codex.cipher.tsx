            <p>Ciphers are uncommon and often misunderstood individuals with 
            extraordinary mental abilities. Like priests and wizards they're 
            able to cast devastating spells, however, ciphers manifest spells 
            through mental prowess alone.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Weapons:</strong> Club, Crossbow, Dagger, Mace, Shortsword, Shortbow, Spear</p>
            
            <p><strong>Armor:</strong> Leather armor and shields</p>
            
            <p><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 1d4 per level</p>
            
            <p><strong>Languages:</strong> You have telepathy (near)</p>

            <p><strong>Psionics.</strong> You cast cipher spells you know by 
            expending focus points. The level of the spell is how many focus 
            points are needed in order to cast.</p>

            <p>To cast a cipher spell you know, make a spellcasting check by rolling 
            1d20 + your Charisma modifier. The DC to successfully cast a spell is 
            10 + the spell's tier in addition to having the appropriate focus points 
            to expend.</p>

            <p>You know two tier 1 spells of your choice from the cipher spell list 
            as well as the Telekinesis spell (cipher only version).</p>

            <p>Each time you gain a level, you choose new cipher spells to learn 
            according to the Cipher Spells Known table below.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Psychic Leech.</strong> Your attacks generate focus, hitting 
            or afflicting an enemy generates 1 focus point. You begin combat with half 
            your level (minimum of 1) focus points. You receive a bonus to melee and 
            ranged attack rolls equal to half your level (minimum of 1).</p>
